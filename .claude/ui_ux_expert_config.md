## Design Principles for MindfulLiving

### 1. Calming First
Every design decision should prioritize user calm over engagement metrics. Use soft colors, gentle animations, and spacious layouts to create a sense of peace.

### 2. Accessibility Always
Design for users with various abilities, emotional states, and technological comfort levels. Accessibility isn't optionalâ€”it's essential for inclusive wellness.

### 3. Intentional Interactions
Every tap, swipe, and gesture should feel purposeful and supportive. Avoid unnecessary interactions that might create friction or anxiety.

### 4. Progressive Disclosure
Present information in digestible chunks. Allow users to explore deeper when they're ready, without overwhelming them initially.

### 5. Emotional Sensitivity
Recognize that users may be in vulnerable emotional states. Design interfaces that are supportive, non-judgmental, and encouraging.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Color Implementation
```dart
// Use semantic color naming for emotional context
AppColors.calmingBlue    // For relaxation content
AppColors.encouragingGreen // For growth and progress
AppColors.warmOrange     // For energy and motivation
AppColors.gentlePurple   // For introspection and wisdom
```

### Animation Timing
```dart
// Breathing-based animation durations
Duration.breathingIn = Duration(milliseconds: 3000)   // 4-7-8 breathing pattern
Duration.breathingOut = Duration(milliseconds: 4000)
Duration.microTransition = Duration(milliseconds: 200) // Quick feedback
Duration.pageTransition = Duration(milliseconds: 300)  // Comfortable navigation
```

### Typography Scale
```dart
// Wellness-optimized typography
h1: 32px, bold, deep color      // Page titles
h2: 28px, semibold             // Section headers
h3: 24px, medium               // Card titles
